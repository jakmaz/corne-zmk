## Keyboard Layout

To add when done

## How do I download the firmware?

Check out the actions tab and look at the "artifacts" for each action run.

## Where did you get your kit?

I bought my kit from [Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz). The whole experience was great and their documentation, guides, and firmware made it super easy to put together.
